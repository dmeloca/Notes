# Regular Expressions
**Regex** 
| Operators | Description|
|-----------|------------|
| (a) | The round brackets are used to group parts of a regex. Within the brackets, you can define further patterns which should be processed together. |
| [a-z]	| The square brackets are used to define character classes. Inside the brackets, you can specify a list of characters to search for. |
| {1,10} | The curly brackets are used to define quantifiers. Inside the brackets, you can specify a number or a range that indicates how often a previous pattern should be repeated. |
| `|` |	Also called the OR operator and shows results when one of the two expressions matches |
| .* | Operates similarly to an AND operator by displaying results only when both expressions are present and match in the specified order |
